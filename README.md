# Do-You-Even-Cook-Bro

Welcome to the Do-You-Even-Cook-Bro project! This project is designed to personalize the Hello Fresh app experience by leveraging user data from smart scales and nutritional information. Our goal is to provide a tailored and sustainable cooking experience for users based on their preferences, allergies, and nutritional needs.

## Overview

The project is structured into three main components:

### 1. Frontend

The frontend of the application is responsible for providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Users can interact with the app to input preferences, view personalized meal recommendations, and access a variety of features. The frontend is designed to enhance the user experience and make cooking enjoyable and effortless.

### 2. Backend

The backend serves as the backbone of the Do-You-Even-Cook-Bro project. It handles the processing of user data from smart scales, accesses nutritional information, and generates personalized meal recommendations. The backend ensures seamless communication between the frontend and other components, providing a robust and efficient system.

### 3. Augmented Reality Application

As an innovative addition, the project includes an augmented reality (AR) application. This application aims to assist users in the cooking process by providing step-by-step guidance, visualizing recipes, and offering real-time information. The AR application adds a layer of interactivity to the cooking experience, making it more engaging and accessible.
